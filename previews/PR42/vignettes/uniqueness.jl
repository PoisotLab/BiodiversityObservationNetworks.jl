# # Selecting environmentally unique locations

# For some applications, we want to sample a set of locations that cover a broad
# range of values in environment space. Another way to rephrase this problem is
# to say we want to find the set of points with the _least_ covariance in their
# environmental values. 

# To do this, we use a `BONRefiner` called `Uniqueness`. We'll start by loading
# the required packages.

# !!! warning "Consider setting your SDMLAYERS_PATH" When accessing data using
#     `SimpleSDMLayers.jl`, it is best to set the `SDM_LAYERSPATH` environmental
#     variable to tell `SimpleSDMLayers.jl` where to download data. This can be
#     done by setting `ENV["SDMLAYERS_PATH"] = "/home/user/Data/"` or similar in
#     the `~/.julia/etc/julia/startup.jl` file. (Note this will be different
#     depending on where `julia` is installed.)

bbox = (left=-83.0, bottom=46.4, right=-55.2, top=63.7);
temp, precip, seasonality, elevation = 
    convert(Float32, SimpleSDMPredictor(WorldClim, BioClim, 7; bbox...)),
    convert(Float32, SimpleSDMPredictor(WorldClim, BioClim, 12; bbox...)),
    convert(Float32, SimpleSDMPredictor(WorldClim, BioClim, 4; bbox...)),
    convert(Float32, SimpleSDMPredictor(WorldClim, Elevation; bbox...));

# Now we'll use the `stack` function to combine our four environmental layers
# into a single, 3-dimensional array, which we'll pass to our `Uniqueness` refiner.
