# Utilities {#Utilities}

`BiodiversityObservationNetworks` includes several utilities for quantifying different aspects of a [`BiodiversityObservationNetwork`](/reference/api#BiodiversityObservationNetworks.BiodiversityObservationNetwork), including the spatial balance of selected sites, the how selected sites cover the space of environmental predictors, and methods for assessing climate rarity and climate velocity, which can be useful as relevant variables for designing [`BiodiversityObservationNetwork`](/reference/api#BiodiversityObservationNetworks.BiodiversityObservationNetwork).

The utilities are divided into the following categories:
- [Spatial Balance](./spatialbalance)
  
- [Environmental Distance](./envdistance)
  
- [Climate Velocity](./velocity)
  
- [Climate Rarity](./rarity)
