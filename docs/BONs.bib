  abstract = {Human activity and land-use change are dramatically altering the sizes, geographical distributions and functioning of biological populations worldwide, with tremendous consequences for human well-being. Yet our ability to measure, monitor and forecast biodiversity change -- crucial to addressing it -- remains limited. Biodiversity monitoring systems are being developed to improve this capacity by deriving metrics of change from an array of in situ data (e.g. field plots or species occurrence records) and Earth observations (EO; e.g. satellite or airborne imagery). However, there are few ecologically based frameworks for integrating these data into meaningful metrics of biodiversity change. Here, I describe how concepts of pattern and scale in ecology could be used to design such a framework. I review three core topics: the role of scale in measuring and modelling biodiversity patterns with EO, scale-dependent challenges linking in situ and EO data and opportunities to apply concepts of pattern and scale to EO to improve biodiversity mapping. From this analysis emerges an actionable approach for measuring, monitoring and forecasting biodiversity change, highlighting key opportunities to establish EO as the backbone of globalscale, science-driven conservation.},

While geospatial modeling offers an opportunity to predict the locations of hotspots using suitable environmental and climatological data, little attention has been paid to optimizing the design of surveys used to inform such models. Here we introduce an adaptive sampling scheme optimized to identify hotspot locations where prevalence exceeds a relevant threshold. Our approach incorporates ideas from Bayesian optimization theory to adaptively select sample batches. We present an experimental simulation study based on survey data of schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis across four countries. Results across all scenarios explored show that adaptive sampling produces superior results and suggest that similar performance to random sampling can be achieved with a fraction of the sample size.},

  abstract = {The question of when to monitor and when to act is fundamental to applied ecology and notoriously difficult to answer. Value of information (VOI) theory holds great promise to help answer this question for many management problems. However, VOI theory in applied ecology has only been demonstrated in single-decision problems and has lacked explicit links between monitoring and management costs. Here, we present an extension of VOI theory for solving multi-unit decisions of whether to monitor before managing, while explicitly accounting for monitoring costs. Our formulation helps to choose the optimal monitoring/management strategy among groups of management units (e.g. species, habitat patches) and can be used to examine the benefits of partial and repeat monitoring. To demonstrate our approach, we use case-simulated studies of single-species protection that must choose among potential habitat areas, and classification and management of multiple species threatened with extinction. We provide spreadsheets and code to illustrate the calculations and facilitate application. Our case studies demonstrate the utility of predicting the number of units with a given outcome for problems with probabilities of discrete states and the efficiency of having a flexible approach to manage according to monitoring outcomes. Synthesis and applications. The decision to act or gather more information can have serious consequences for management. No decision, including the decision to monitor, is risk-free. Our multi-unit expansion of Value of Information theory can reduce the risk in monitoring/acting decisions for many applied ecology problems. While our approach cannot account for the potential value of discovering previously unknown threats or ecological processes via monitoring programmes, it can provide quantitative guidance on whether to monitor before acting, and which monitoring/management actions are most likely to meet management objectives.},

  abstract = {A methodology for the choice of optimal spatial sampling designs is proposed. The problem is to find an optimal finite set of space locations where a random field has to be sampled, in order to minimize the variability of the parametric variogram estimator. Under the hypothesis that the random field is Gaussian second-order stationary and using a first-order approximation for the linearization of the parametric variogram with respect to its parameters, we are able to express the covariance matrix of the parameter estimators as a function of the sampling design. An optimization algorithm based on a generalized least squares approach is proposed in order to reduce the variability of these estimators through the minimization of the determinant of their covariance matrix. In order to validate this approach, a practical case study is conducted for two different variogram models. It shows that compared to random sampling designs, the benefit of the optimization procedure is somewhat limited for a variogram model without nugget effect. For a variogram model with nugget effect, random sampling designs are associated with much higher variability on the parameter estimators than optimized designs because of the typical lack of information offered by random sampling designs for small distances between locations. The performance of random sampling designs compared to optimized or alternative regular designs is shown to be poor with respect to parameter estimation, especially when a nugget effect is included in the variogram model. The parameters that benefit the most from the optimization procedure are the variance and the nugget effect, whereas the improvement for the range parameter estimation is limited. The optimization algorithm provides yardstick results, yielding reference values for the selection of an alternative regular design. The applicability of the algorithm is very wide, and it can greatly help the user to understand the way the parameters are influenced by the choice of a set of sampling locations instead of another.},

  abstract = {Big biodiversity data sets have great potential for monitoring and research because of their large taxonomic, geographic and temporal scope. Such data sets have become especially important for assessing temporal changes in species' populations and distributions. Gaps in the available data, especially spatial and temporal gaps, often mean that the data are not representative of the target population. This hinders drawing large-scale inferences, such as about species' trends, and may lead to misplaced conservation action. Here, we conceptualise gaps in biodiversity monitoring data as a missing data problem, which provides a unifying framework for the challenges and potential solutions across different types of biodiversity data sets. We characterise the typical types of data gaps as different classes of missing data and then use missing data theory to explore the implications for questions about species' trends and factors affecting occurrences/abundances. By using this framework, we show that bias due to data gaps can arise when the factors affecting sampling and/or data availability overlap with those affecting species. But a data set per se is not biased. The outcome depends on the ecological question and statistical approach, which determine choices around which sources of variation are taken into account. We argue that typical approaches to long-term species trend modelling using monitoring data are especially susceptible to data gaps since such models do not tend to account for the factors driving missingness. To identify general solutions to this problem, we review empirical studies and use simulation studies to compare some of the most frequently employed approaches to deal with data gaps, including subsampling, weighting and imputation. All these methods have the potential to reduce bias but may come at the cost of increased uncertainty of parameter estimates. Weighting techniques are arguably the least used so far in ecology and have the potential to reduce both the bias and variance of parameter estimates. Regardless of the method, the ability to reduce bias critically depends on knowledge of, and the availability of data on, the factors creating data gaps. We use this review to outline the necessary considerations when dealing with data gaps at different stages of the data collection and analysis workflow.},

  abstract = {Environmental monitoring is a key component of understanding and managing ecosystems. Given that most monitoring efforts are still expensive and time-consuming, it is essential that monitoring programs are designed to be efficient and effective. In many situations, the expensive part of monitoring is not sample collection, but instead sample processing, which leads to only a subset of the samples being processed. For example, sediment or ice cores can be quickly obtained in the field, but they require weeks or months of processing in a laboratory setting. Standard sub-sampling approaches often involve equally-spaced sampling on depth. We use simulations to show how many samples, and which types of sampling approaches, are the most effective in detecting ecosystem change. We test these ideas with a case study of Cladocera community assemblage indicators reconstructed from a sediment core. We demonstrate that standard approaches to sample processing are less efficient than an iterative approach. For our case study, using an optimal sampling approach would have resulted in savings of 195 person--hours---thousands of dollars in labor costs. We also show that, compared with these standard approaches, fewer samples are typically needed to achieve high statistical power. We explain how our approach can be applied to monitoring programs that rely on video records, eDNA, remote sensing, and other common tools that allow re-sampling.},

Camera traps are a cost-effective, noninvasive means of sampling communities of mid-to large-terrestrial species, and acoustic recording devices capture human sounds and sound-producing animals, including species of mammals, birds, anurans, and insects. Rarely are these techniques combined, despite the advantages of merging their respective strengths. Namely, camera traps paired with acoustic recorders can evaluate the abundance, distribution, and behavior of multiple guilds and trophic levels across landscapes while concurrently monitoring multiple human stressors in real time. Moreover, integrating these approaches enhances detection accuracy and strengthens statistical inference at multiple survey scales. We conducted a literature review, and found only 13 studies that combine camera traps and acoustic recorders, 8 of which either compared the ability of each technique to detect species of interest or discussed the advantages of each technique. We outline potential questions that can be addressed by pairing acoustic recorders and camera traps, including enabling the simultaneous assessment of noise pollution and its impacts on mammal and avian communities. Furthermore, we discuss how the analysis of data from each technique face similar challenges; thus, simultaneous innovation offers the ability to apply solutions to both techniques and amplify their respective strengths. Digital technologies and big data are changing nature conservation in increasingly profound ways and integration of camera traps and acoustic recorders will facilitate new, transformative discoveries to meet modern conservation challenges.},

  abstract = {Conservation biocontrol, the regulation of crop pests by naturally occurring biocontrol agents (e.g., predators and parasitoids), is predominantly monitored throughout periods of primary crop growth when pests exert the most observable impact on yields. Pest-focused agricultural biomonitoring often overlooks post-harvest, winter and even early-season biocontrol, despite the significant predator--pest interactions during these periods that profoundly affect pest abundance and, consequently, crop yields. Rapid advances in biomonitoring, particularly in the detection of predator--pest interactions that underpin biocontrol, provide an opportunity to reconsider how and when we monitor these interactions. Advances in agricultural biomonitoring must transcend methodological innovation and encompass conceptual changes in the monitoring of agricultural systems. Here, we assess existing evidence supporting the importance of periods beyond primary crop growth for biocontrol and how predator--pest interactions are likely to evolve during these periods, subsequently influencing pest population dynamics during the primary crop growth period. We advocate for a greater concerted effort to establish continuous monitoring of biocontrol interactions, particularly beyond primary crop growth periods in temperate climates. To facilitate this, we also summarise the methodological approaches that can make it possible and explore how extending sampling across the full annual cycle might impact the practicalities and outcomes of these approaches. Year-round monitoring of biocontrol interactions, both in crops and adjacent semi-natural habitats, will provide a previously intractable understanding of predator--pest dynamics, offering significant potential to enhance our ability to optimise and manipulate these systems. This would manifest in reduced crop yield losses, pest infestation rates and disease transmission, with concomitant long-term financial, environmental and land-use benefits.},

In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted ``punctual models''). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (``ablation experiments''). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

  abstract = {Effective natural resources management requires accurate information about species distributions. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a commonly used method to determine species presence and distribution. However, when understanding eDNA-based distribution data, managers must contend with imperfect detection in collection samples and subsamples (i.e., molecular analyses) impacting their ability to detect species and estimate occurrence. Occurrence models can estimate 3 probabilities: occurrence, capture, and eDNA detection. However, most occurrence models do not. To quantify imperfect detection in rare versus common species, we examined multiple field capture and detection probabilities. We studied this with 3 objectives: Determine sample sizes required to detect eDNA given imperfect detection, determine sample sizes required to estimate eDNA capture parameters, and examine performance of a 3-level occurrence model. We found detecting eDNA in {$\geq$}1 sample at a site required {$\leq$}15 samples per site for common species, but detecting eDNA when looking for rare species required 45 to 90 samples per site. Our occurrence model recovered known parameters unless capture and detection probabilities were {$<$}0.2 where {$>$}100 samples per site and {$\geq$}8 molecular replicates were required. Our findings illustrate the importance of sample size and molecular replication for eDNA-based work. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:760--771. Published 2019.

  abstract = {A robust scientific conclusion is the result of a rigorous scientific process. In observational ecology, this process involves making inferences about a population from a sample. The sample is crucial, and is the result of implementing a survey design. A good survey design ensures that the data from the survey are capable of answering the research question. Better designs, such as spatially balanced designs, will also be as precise as possible given the constraints of the budget. Many study areas will have previously sampled `legacy sites' that already have accumulated a time series of observations. For estimating trent, it is often beneficial to include these sites within a new survey. In this paper, we propose a method to incorporate the locations of legacy sites into new spatially balanced survey designs to ensure spatial balance among all sample locations. Simulation experiments indicate that incorporating the spatial location of legacy sites increases spatial balance and decreases uncertainty in inferences (smaller standard errors in mean estimates) when compared to designs that ignore legacy site locations. We illustrate the process of incorporating legacy sites using a proposed survey of a large marine reserve in South-Eastern Australia, although the method is applicable to all environments. Our approach allows for integration of legacy sites into a new spatially balanced design, increasing efficiency. Scientists, managers and funders alike will benefit from this methodology -- it provides a tool to provide efficient survey designs around established ones, including in-the-field adjustments. In this way, it can aid integrated monitoring programmes. An R-package that implements these methods, called MBHdesign, is available from CRAN.},

  abstract = {Many sampling techniques rely on taking measurements along a transect; an example is underwater imagery from towed platforms used for marine ecological studies. Despite transect-based sampling being commonly used, methods to generate randomized survey designs have not hitherto been developed. We develop methods to generate random transect designs, which respect the user-defined probability of sampling each grid cell (the cell inclusion probabilities). We show how to: (a) define transect inclusion probabilities from user-specified cell inclusion probabilities, which allows particular environments to be sampled more often; (b) alter the cell and transect inclusion probabilities so that when transects are sampled the frequencies of sampling cells approximate the cell inclusion probabilities, and; (c) draw a spatially balanced probability sample of transects. The spatially balanced transect designs approximately maintain the cell inclusion probabilities. The greatest of the small departures occur near the extreme corners of our convex study region, which are difficult to place transects into. The proposed designs also exhibit superior spatial balance compared to the non-balanced counterparts. We illustrate the successful application of the method to a towed-camera survey of deep-sea (500--2,000 m depths) seamounts off Tasmania, Australia. This was a challenging application due to the complex topology of the setting, and uneven inclusion probabilities for the property of interest -- the presence of a stony coral. Our approach develops the randomization approach to transect-based surveys, thereby ensuring that transect-based surveys can enjoy the same benefits as random point-based surveys. The method approximates the cell inclusion probabilities, and does so while spatially balancing the transects throughout the study area. Practitioners can access the methods through the R-package MBHdesign, which is available from CRAN. We anticipate that it will act as a cornerstone for transect-based ecological monitoring programmes.},

  abstract = {Aim Species distribution modelling, a family of statistical methods that predicts species distributions from a set of occurrences and environmental predictors, is now routinely applied in many macroecological studies. However, the reliability of evaluation metrics usually employed to validate these models remains questioned. Moreover, the emergence of online databases of environmental variables with global coverage, especially climatic, has favoured the use of the same set of standard predictors. Unfortunately, the selection of variables is too rarely based on a careful examination of the species' ecology. In this context, our aim was to highlight the importance of selecting ad hoc variables in species distribution models, and to assess the ability of classical evaluation statistics to identify models with no biological realism. Innovation First, we reviewed the current practices in the field of species distribution modelling in terms of variable selection and model evaluation. Then, we computed distribution models of 509 European species using pseudo-predictors derived from paintings or using a real set of climatic and topographic predictors. We calculated model performance based on the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS), partitioning occurrences into training and test data with different levels of spatial independence. Most models computed from pseudo-predictors were classified as good and sometimes were even better evaluated than models computed using real environmental variables. However, on average they were better discriminated when the partitioning of occurrences allowed testing for model transferability. Main conclusions These findings confirm the crucial importance of variable selection and the inability of current evaluation metrics to assess the biological significance of distribution models. We recommend that researchers carefully select variables according to the species' ecology and evaluate models only according to their capacity to be transfered in distant areas. Nevertheless, statistics of model evaluations must still be interpreted with great caution.},

However, we are still unable to map species shifts at high spatial, temporal, and taxonomic resolution.

Our model---Deepbiosphere---not only outperforms many common species distribution modeling approaches (AUC 0.95 vs. 0.88) but can map species at up to a few meters resolution and finely delineate plant communities with high accuracy, including the pristine and clear-cut forests of Redwood National Park. These fine-scale predictions can further be used to map the intensity of habitat fragmentation and sharp ecosystem transitions across human-altered landscapes. In addition, from frequent collections of remote sensing data, Deepbiosphere can detect the rapid effects of severe wildfire on plant community composition across a 2-y time period. These findings demonstrate that integrating public earth observations and citizen science with deep learning can pave the way toward automated systems for monitoring biodiversity change in real-time worldwide.},

Changes in species diversity and high rates of compositional turnover have been reported worldwide. In many cases, trends in biodiversity are detected, but these trends are rarely causally attributed to possible drivers. A formal framework and guidelines for the detection and attribution of biodiversity change is needed. We propose an inferential framework to guide detection and attribution analyses, which identifies five steps---causal modelling, observation, estimation, detection and attribution---for robust attribution. This workflow provides evidence of biodiversity change in relation to hypothesized impacts of multiple potential drivers and can eliminate putative drivers from contention. The framework encourages a formal and reproducible statement of confidence about the role of drivers after robust methods for trend detection and attribution have been deployed. Confidence in trend attribution requires that data and analyses used in all steps of the framework follow best practices reducing uncertainty at each step. We illustrate these steps with examples. This framework could strengthen the bridge between biodiversity science and policy and support effective actions to halt biodiversity loss and the impacts this has on ecosystems.

A synthesis of fragmentation experiments spanning multiple biomes and scales, five continents, and 35 years demonstrates that habitat fragmentation reduces biodiversity by 13 to 75\% and impairs key ecosystem functions by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles. Effects are greatest in the smallest and most isolated fragments, and they magnify with the passage of time. These findings indicate an urgent need for conservation and restoration measures to improve landscape connectivity, which will reduce extinction rates and help maintain ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Aim To propose a species distribution modelling framework and its companion ``iSDM'' R package for predicting the potential and realized distributions of invasive species within the invaded range. Location Northern France. Methods The non-equilibrium distribution of invasive species with the environment within the invaded range affects the environmental representativeness of species presence--absence data collected from the field and introduces uncertainty in observed absences as these may either reflect unsuitable sites or be incidental. To address these issues, we here propose an environmental systematic sampling design to collect presence--absence data from the field and a probability index to sort and subsequently separate environmental absences (EAs: reflecting environmentally unsuitable sites) from dispersal-limited absences (DLAs: reflecting sites out of dispersal reach). We first conducted a comprehensive test based on a virtual species to evaluate the performance of our framework. Then, we applied it on different life stages of a non-native tree species (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) invasive in Europe. Results Regarding the potential distribution, we found higher model performances for both the virtual species (true skill statistics (TSS) {$>$} 0.75) and P. serotina (TSS {$\geq$} 0.68) after carefully selecting absences with a low probability to be DLAs compared with classical models that incorporate both EAs and DLAs (e.g. TSS = 0.11 for P. serotina with 80\% of DLAs). On the contrary, both EAs and DLAs as well as dispersal-related covariates were needed to capture the realized distribution of both the virtual species and P. serotina. Main Conclusions Our framework helps overcoming the conceptual and methodological limitations of the disequilibrium in species' distribution models inherent to invasive species and enables managers to robustly estimate both the realized and potential distributions of invasive species. Although more relevant for modelling the distribution of non-native species, this framework can also be applied to native species.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

This paper compares four such strategies, namely, `random', `regular', `proportional-stratified' and `equal-stratified'---to investigate (1) how they affect prediction accuracy and (2) how sensitive they are to sample size. In order to compare them, a virtual species approach (Ecol. Model. 145 (2001) 111) in a real landscape, based on reliable data, was chosen. The distribution of the virtual species was sampled 300 times using each of the four strategies in four sample sizes. The sampled data were then fed into a GLM to make two types of prediction: (1) habitat suitability and (2) presence/absence. Comparing the predictions to the known distribution of the virtual species allows model accuracy to be assessed. Habitat suitability predictions were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and presence/absence predictions by Cohen's {$\kappa$} agreement coefficient. The results show the `regular' and `equal-stratified' sampling strategies to be the most accurate and most robust. We propose the following characteristics to improve sample design: (1) increase sample size, (2) prefer systematic to random sampling and (3) include environmental information in the design.},

Four previously proposed shortfalls pinpoint knowledge gaps for species taxonomy (Linnean), distribution (Wallacean), abundance (Prestonian), and evolutionary patterns (Darwinian). We also redefine the Hutchinsonian shortfall to apply to the abiotic tolerances of species and propose new shortfalls relating to limited knowledge of species traits (Raunki{\ae}ran) and biotic interactions (Eltonian). We conclude with a general framework for the combined impacts and consequences of shortfalls of large-scale biodiversity knowledge for evolutionary and ecological research and consider ways of overcoming the seven shortfalls and dealing with the uncertainty they generate.},

High elevations and deep seas are particularly unknown. Over 50\% of records in most groups account for under 2\% of species and citizen-science only exacerbates biases.

Critical transitions pose extremely challenging forecasting problems, which necessitate informative uncertainty estimation rather than point forecasts. In this study, we apply some of the most cutting edge deep learning methods for probabilistic time series forecasting to several classic ecological models that examine critical transitions. Our analysis focuses on three different simulated examples of critical transitions: a Hopf bifurcation, a saddle-node bifurcation and a stochastic transition. For each scenario, we compare the forecasts from four deep learning models, long-short term memory networks, gated recurrent unit networks, lock recurrent neural networks and transformers, to forecasts from an ARIMA model and a MCMC estimated model that is given the true transition dynamics. We found that the deep learning models were able to perform comparably to the idealized MCMC model on the stochastic transition case, and generally in between the MCMC and ARIMA models on the Hopf and saddle-node bifurcation examples. Our results establish that deep learning methods warrant further exploration on the challenging class of critical transition forecasting problems.},

  abstract = {Increased efforts are required to prevent further losses to terrestrial~biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it~ provides1,2. Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether---and how---humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by~the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042--2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34--50\%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats---such as climate change---must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.},

  abstract = {In ecological field surveys, observations are gathered at different spatial locations. The purpose may be to relate biological response variables (e.g., species abundances) to explanatory environmental variables (e.g., soil characteristics). In the absence of prior knowledge, ecologists have been taught to rely on systematic or random sampling designs. If there is prior knowledge about the spatial patterning of the explanatory variables, obtained from either previous surveys or a pilot study, can we use this information to optimize the sampling design in order to maximize our ability to detect the relationships between the response and explanatory variables? The specific questions addressed in this paper are: a) What is the effect (type I error) of spatial autocorrelation on the statistical tests commonly used by ecologists to analyse field survey data? b) Can we eliminate, or at least minimize, the effect of spatial autocorrelation by the design of the survey? Are there designs that provide greater power for surveys, at least under certain circumstances? c) Can we eliminate or control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation during the analysis? To answer the last question, we compared regular regression analysis to a modified t-test developed by Dutilleul for correlation coefficients in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Replicated surfaces (typically, 1000 of them) were simulated using different spatial parameters, and these surfaces were subjected to different sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis. The simulated surfaces may represent, for example, vegetation response to underlying environmental variation. This allowed us 1) to measure the frequency of type I error (the failure to reject the null hypothesis when in fact there is no effect of the environment on the response variable) and 2) to estimate the power of the different combinations of sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis (power is measured by the rate of rejection of the null hypothesis when an effect of the environment on the response variable has been created). Our results indicate that: 1) Spatial autocorrelation in both the response and environmental variables affects the classical tests of significance of correlation or regression coefficients. Spatial autocorrelation in only one of the two variables does not affect the test of significance. 2) A broad-scale spatial structure present in data has the same effect on the tests as spatial autocorrelation. When such a structure is present in one of the variables and autocorrelation is found in the other, or in both, the tests of significance have inflated rates of type I error. 3) Dutilleul's modified t-test for the correlation coefficient, corrected for spatial autocorrelation, effectively corrects for spatial autocorrelation in the data. It also effectively corrects for the presence of deterministic structures, with or without spatial autocorrelation. The presence of a broad-scale deterministic structure may, in some cases, reduce the power of the modified t-test.},

  abstract = {Recent analyses have reported catastrophic global declines in vertebrate populations1,2. However, the distillation of many trends into a global mean index obscures the variation that can inform conservation measures and can be sensitive to analytical decisions. For example, previous analyses have estimated a mean vertebrate decline of more than 50\% since 1970 (Living Planet Index2). Here we show, however, that this estimate is driven by less than 3\% of vertebrate populations; if these extremely declining populations are excluded, the global trend switches to an increase. The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed. We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends. We show that, of taxonomic--geographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1\% of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4\% of populations). The remaining 98.6\% of populations across all systems showed no mean global trend. However, when analysed separately, three systems were declining strongly with high certainty (all in the Indo-Pacific region) and seven were declining strongly but with less certainty (mostly reptile and amphibian groups). Accounting for extreme clusters fundamentally alters the interpretation of global vertebrate trends and should be used to help to prioritize conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {Large-scale NLP models have been shown to significantly improve the performance on language tasks with no signs of saturation. They also demonstrate amazing few-shot capabilities like that of human beings. This paper aims to explore large-scale models in computer vision. We tackle three major issues in training and application of large vision models, including training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on labelled data. Three main techniques are proposed: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images. Through these techniques, this paper successfully trained a 3 billion-parameter Swin Transformer V2 model, which is the largest dense vision model to date, and makes it capable of training with images of up to 1,536\${\textbackslash}times\$1,536 resolution. It set new performance records on 4 representative vision tasks, including ImageNet-V2 image classification, COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, and Kinetics-400 video action classification. Also note our training is much more efficient than that in Google's billion-level visual models, which consumes 40 times less labelled data and 40 times less training time.

  abstract = {Bioacoustic sensors, sometimes known as autonomous recording units (ARUs), can record sounds of wildlife over long periods of time in scalable and minimally invasive ways. Deriving per-species abundance estimates from these sensors requires detection, classification, and quantification of animal vocalizations as individual acoustic events. Yet, variability in ambient noise, both over time and across sensors, hinders the reliability of current automated systems for sound event detection (SED), such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the time-frequency domain. In this article, we develop, benchmark, and combine several machine listening techniques to improve the generalizability of SED models across heterogeneous acoustic environments. As a case study, we consider the problem of detecting avian flight calls from a ten-hour recording of nocturnal bird migration, recorded by a network of six ARUs in the presence of heterogeneous background noise. Starting from a CNN yielding state-of-the-art accuracy on this task, we introduce two noise adaptation techniques, respectively integrating short-term (60 ms) and long-term (30 min) context. First, we apply per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) in the time-frequency domain, which applies short-term automatic gain control to every subband in the mel-frequency spectrogram. Secondly, we replace the last dense layer in the network by a context-adaptive neural network (CA-NN) layer, i.e. an affine layer whose weights are dynamically adapted at prediction time by an auxiliary network taking long-term summary statistics of spectrotemporal features as input. We show that PCEN reduces temporal overfitting across dawn vs. dusk audio clips whereas context adaptation on PCEN-based summary statistics reduces spatial overfitting across sensor locations. Moreover, combining them yields state-of-the-art results that are unmatched by artificial data augmentation alone. We release a pre-trained version of our best performing system under the name of BirdVoxDetect, a ready-to-use detector of avian flight calls in field recordings.},

A method is described for designing optimal sampling schemes. It is based on the theory of regionalized variables, and assumes that spatial dependence is expressed quantitatively in the form of the semi-variogram. It assumes also that the maximum standard error of a kriged estimate is a reasonable measure of the goodness of a sampling scheme. By sampling on a regular triangular grid, the maximum standard error is kept to a minimum for any given sampling, but a square grid is approximately equivalent where variation is isotropic. Given the semi-variogram for a variable, the sampling density for any prescribed maximum standard error is determined. Where variation is geometrically anisotropic, the same method is employed to determine sample spacing in the direction of maximum change, and the grid mesh elongated in the perpendicular direction in proportion to the anisotropy ratio.},

  abstract = {Site selection bias can occur when researchers monitor animals at sites of great abundance, occupancy or quality. The prevailing heuristic is therefore that ecologists should never select sites using these criteria. There is thus concern that common monitoring schemes including surveys at colonies, migratory bottlenecks and artificial breeding sites intentionally monitor sites of great abundance. Whether such routine monitoring schemes likely succumb to site selection bias is unexamined. We simulate the dynamics of long-lived vertebrate populations to test three potential pitfalls hypothesized to occur when sites are selected for monitoring based on abundance, occupancy or quality. (1) For regression to the mean, population levels might appear to decline at monitored sites because they were chosen during a peak of abundance and random fluctuations cause populations to decrease from that point. (2) Preferential sampling occurs when some sites are preferred by the focal organism and have an above-average probability of being selected for monitoring. (3) The missing zero effect occurs when occupied sites are chosen more often for monitoring because of initial or historical occupancy. Our simulations demonstrate that regression to the mean should only occur when inter-annual fluctuations in abundance are relatively large compared with the average difference between sites. If researchers monitor sites that are truly of great average abundance, regression to the mean is avoided. Preferential sampling can cause a delay in the detection of a decline because monitored sites are preferred by the focal species and thus should be the first to be occupied and the last to be abandoned. Finally, the missing zero effect can cause a perceived decline in a stable population because sites were chosen when they were initially occupied and thus can only be abandoned, whereas potential colonizations at initially unoccupied sites cannot be observed. Regression to the mean occurred during specific circumstances that do not seem biologically plausible for some study systems (e.g. colony surveys). It is therefore impractical to apply a single simple heuristic such as `never monitor animals at sites of great abundance' across organisms of varying life histories.},

  abstract = {Aim Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) often involve some degree of projection into novel covariate space (i.e. extrapolation), because calibration data may not encompass the entire space of interest. Most methods for identifying extrapolation focus on the range of each model covariate individually. However, extrapolation can occur that is well within the range of univariate variation, but which exhibits novel combinations between covariates. Our objective was to develop a tool that can detect, distinguish and quantify these two types of novelties: novel univariate range and novel combinations of covariates. Location Global, Australia, South Africa. Methods We developed a new multivariate statistical tool, based on the Mahalanobis distance, which measures the similarity between the reference and projection domains by accounting for both the deviation from the mean and the correlation between variables. The method also provides an assessment tool for the detection of the most influential covariates leading to dissimilarity. As an example application, we modelled an Australian shrub (Acacia cyclops) widely introduced to other countries and compared reference data, global distribution data and both types of model extrapolation against the projection globally and in South Africa. Results The new tool successfully detected and quantified the degree of dissimilarity for points that were either outside the univariate range or formed novel covariate combinations (correlations) but were still within the univariate range of covariates. For A. cyclops, more than half of the points (6617 of 10,785) from the global projection space that were found to lie within the univariate range of reference data exhibited distorted correlations. Not all the climate covariates used for modelling contributed to novelty equally over the geographical space of the model projection. Main conclusions Identifying non-analogous environments is a critical component of model interrogation. Our extrapolation detection (ExDet) tool can be used as a quantitative method for exploring novelty and interpreting the projections from correlative SDMs and is available for free download as stand-alone software from http://www.climond.org/exdet.},

Limited biodiversity information is widely recognized as a major barrier for identifying temporal baselines, although a comprehensive quantitative assessment of this is lacking. Here, we report on the temporal baselines that could be drawn from biodiversity monitoring schemes in Europe and compare those with the rise of important anthropogenic pressures. Most biodiversity monitoring schemes were initiated late in the 20th century, well after anthropogenic pressures had already reached half of their current magnitude. Setting temporal baselines from biodiversity monitoring data would therefore underestimate the full range of impacts of major anthropogenic pressures. In addition, biases among taxa and organization levels provide a truncated picture of biodiversity over time. These limitations need to be explicitly acknowledged when designing management strategies and policies as they seriously constrain our ability to identify relevant conservation targets aimed at restoring or reversing biodiversity losses. We discuss the need for additional research efforts beyond standard biodiversity monitoring to reconstruct the impacts of major anthropogenic pressures and to identify meaningful temporal baselines for biodiversity.},

Species exist in two spaces that are linked in the so-called Hutchinsonian Duality: distributions in geographical space and ecological niches in environmental space. We explore implications of using distinct methods to select locations for biodiversity inventories, based on this idea of two-space distributions. We combined empirical and statistical methods to facilitate selecting localities for biodiversity inventory based on either or both of geographical and environmental considerations. These approaches were applied to select sites for inventory in four example countries. For one of our examples, we tested how effective distinct methods were in sampling biodiversity. Random and geographically uniform selections are generally biased towards the most common environments in the regions; selections aiming for uniform sampling of environments are concentrated spatially in areas of high heterogeneity in geographical context. Considering disparate geographical distributions of environments helped to cover geographical areas more broadly when selections were environmentally uniform. Generally, sets of sites selected considering environmental conditions perform better in sampling known biodiversity in regions of interest. Our results underline the benefits of considering environmental and geographical conditions when selecting sites on the effectiveness of resulting inventories. Our tools, implemented in the r package biosurvey, will help researchers to design biodiversity survey systems taking into account the Hutchinsonian Duality and the crucial considerations that it suggests.},

Location Global. Methods We outlined a framework for strengthening confidence in inferences drawn from biological climate impact studies through the systematic integration of prior expectations, long-term data and quantitative statistical procedures. We then developed a numerical confidence index (Cindex) and used it to evaluate current practices in 208 studies of marine climate impacts comprising 1735 biological time series. Results Confidence scores for inferred climate impacts varied widely from 1 to 16 (very low to high confidence). Approximately 35\% of analyses were not associated with clearly stated prior expectations and 65\% of analyses did not test putative non-climate drivers of biological change. Among the highest-scoring studies, 91\% tested prior expectations, 86\% formulated expectations for alternative drivers but only 63\% statistically tested them. Higher confidence scores observed in studies that did not detect a change or tracked multiple species suggest publication bias favouring impact studies that are consistent with climate change. The number of time series showing climate impacts was a poor predictor of average confidence scores for a given group, reinforcing that vote-counting methodology is not appropriate for determining overall confidence in inferences. Main conclusions Climate impacts research is expected to attribute biological change to climate change with measurable confidence. Studies with long-term, high-resolution data, appropriate statistics and tests of alternative drivers earn higher Cindex scores, suggesting these should be given greater weight in impact assessments. Together with our proposed framework, the results of our Cindex analysis indicate how the science of detecting and attributing biological impacts to climate change can be strengthened through the use of evidence-based prior expectations and thorough statistical analyses, even when data are limited, maximizing the impact of the diverse and growing climate change ecology literature.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Indicators of biodiversity change across large extents of geographic, temporal and taxonomic space are frequent products of various types of ecological monitoring and other data collection efforts. Unfortunately, many such indicators are based on data that are highly unlikely to be representative of the intended statistical populations: they are biased with respect to their estimands. Where there is full control over sampling processes, individual units within a population have known response propensities, but these are unknown in the absence of any statistical design. This could be due to the voluntary nature of surveys or because of data aggregation. In these cases some degree of sampling bias is inevitable and we must do something to ameliorate it. One such option is poststratification to adjust for uneven surveying of strata assumed to be important for unbiased estimation. We propose that a similar strategy can be used for the prioritisation of future data collection: that is, an adaptive sampling process focused on actively increasing representativeness defined in terms of response propensities. This is easily achieved by monitoring the proportional allocation of sampled units in strata relative to that expected under simple random sampling. The allocation of new units is thus that which reduces the departure from randomness (or, equivalently, that equalising response propensities across population units), allowing an estimator to approach that level of error expected under random sampling. We describe the theory supporting this straightforward strategy, and demonstrate its application using the National Plant Monitoring Scheme, a UK-focused, structured citizen science monitoring programme with uneven uptake.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Sampling bias is an inherent problem in widely available biodiversity data, undermining the robustness of correlative species distribution models (SDMs). To some extent, subsampling occurrence data can account for uneven sampling efforts; yet, conventional approaches subsample in geographical space, while subsampling in environmental space remains underexplored. Here, we compared the effectiveness of subsampling methods that correct sampling bias either in geographical space (spatial gridding, spatial distance thinning) or directly in environmental space (environmental gridding), including two novel approaches introduced here: environmental clustering and environmental distance thinning. We hypothesised that environmental subsampling methods would be more effective in improving SDM performance across its three primary uses: explaining, predicting, and projecting. Using a virtual ecologist framework, we assessed SDM performance against four evaluation tests: replicating true species--environment response curves, predicting within the sampling region via internal cross-validation and evaluation against independent data, and projecting outside the sampling region. Our findings demonstrate that environmental subsampling methods, especially environmental clustering and environmental distance thinning, outperformed other methods in yielding robust SDMs in almost all evaluation tests. Interestingly, cross-validation favoured SDMs with no sampling bias correction, highlighting the inability of cross-validation to identify unbiased models. Our findings emphasise a critical conceptual disconnect: SDMs appearing to perform well in predicting species' distributions may not reliably estimate species--environment relationships, nor transfer predictions onto novel environments. Environmental subsampling methods are reliable approaches for all uses, but are particularly suited for explaining species' niches and transferring predictions across space and/or time, such as when anticipating species' responses to climate change or assessing the risk of biological invasions. Conversely, geographic subsampling methods may suffice for predicting species' distributions within their current environmental context, as required in conservation planning. Our study firmly establishes the critical importance of correcting environmental sampling bias, while also providing reliable solutions for supporting biodiversity conservation in an ever-changing world.},

  abstract = {Ecological networks are increasingly studied at large spatial scales, expanding their focus from a conceptual tool for community ecology into one that also addresses questions in biogeography and macroecology. This effort is supported by increased access to standardized information on ecological networks, in the form of openly accessible databases. Yet, there has been no systematic evaluation of the fitness for purpose of these data to explore synthesis questions at very large spatial scales. In particular, because the sampling of ecological networks is a difficult task, they are likely to not have a good representation of the diversity of Earth's bioclimatic conditions, likely to be spatially aggregated, and therefore unlikely to achieve broad representativeness. In this paper, we analyse over 1300 ecological networks in the mangal.io database, and discuss their coverage of climates, and the geographic areas in which there is a deficit of data on ecological networks. Taken together, our results suggest that while some information about the global structure of ecological networks is available, it remains fragmented over space, with further differences by types of ecological interactions. This causes great concerns both for our ability to transfer knowledge from one region to the next, but also to forecast the structural change in networks under climate change.},

  abstract = {Large, well described gaps exist in both what we know and what we need to know to address the biodiversity crisis. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers new potential for filling these knowledge gaps, but where the biggest and most influential gains could be made remains unclear. To date, biodiversity-related uses of AI have largely focused on tracking and monitoring of wildlife populations. Rapid progress is being made in the use of AI to build phylogenetic trees and species distribution models. However, AI also has considerable unrealized potential in the re-evaluation of important ecological questions, especially those that require the integration of disparate and inherently complex data types, such as images, video, text, audio and DNA. This Review describes the current and potential future use of AI to address seven clearly defined shortfalls in biodiversity knowledge. Recommended steps for AI-based improvements include the re-use of existing image data and the development of novel paradigms, including the collaborative generation of new testable hypotheses. The resulting expansion of biodiversity knowledge could lead to science spanning from genes to ecosystems --- advances that might represent our best hope for meeting the rapidly approaching 2030 targets of the Global Biodiversity Framework.},

The differentiation GSTbecomes a natural extension of Wright's FSTand generalizes Weir and Cockerham's parameter of co-ancestry by relaxing the assumption of identical correlation for all the alleles. Inter- and intrapopulation variances of the estimated diversities and differentiation are derived. Finally, the optimal sampling strategy for measuring GSTwhen a fixed number of individuals can be analysed is considered. It is shown that, at a given locus, there is a unique sample size per population which yields the smallest variance of GST,regardless of the number of populations studied. These theoretical developments are illustrated with an analysis of chloroplast DNA diversity in a forest tree. The results emphasize the necessity of sampling many populations, rather than many individuals per population, for an accurate measurement of the subdivision of gene diversity at a single locus.},

Here we demonstrate the links between data sources, EBVs and indicators and discuss how different sources of biodiversity observations can be harnessed to inform EBVs. We classify sources of primary observations into four types: extensive and intensive monitoring schemes, ecological field studies and satellite remote sensing. We characterize their geographic, taxonomic and temporal coverage. Ecological field studies and intensive monitoring schemes inform a wide range of EBVs, but the former tend to deliver short-term data, while the geographic coverage of the latter is limited. In contrast, extensive monitoring schemes mostly inform the population abundance EBV, but deliver long-term data across an extensive network of sites. Satellite remote sensing is particularly suited to providing information on ecosystem function and structure EBVs. Biases behind data sources may affect the representativeness of global biodiversity datasets. To improve them, researchers must assess data sources and then develop strategies to compensate for identified gaps. We draw on the population abundance dataset informing the Living Planet Index (LPI) to illustrate the effects of data sources on EBV representativeness. We find that long-term monitoring schemes informing the LPI are still scarce outside of Europe and North America and that ecological field studies play a key role in covering that gap. Achieving representative EBV datasets will depend both on the ability to integrate available data, through data harmonization and modeling efforts, and on the establishment of new monitoring programs to address critical data gaps.},

Effective management requires the detection of populations, which can sometimes be at low densities and is usually based on visual detection and counting.

A spatially balanced design selects a sample that is evenly distributed over the extent of the resource. In this article we present a new spatially balanced design that can be used to select a sample from discrete and continuous populations in multi-dimensional space. The design, which we call balanced acceptance sampling, utilizes the Halton sequence to assure spatial diversity of selected locations. Targeted inclusion probabilities are achieved by acceptance sampling. The BAS design is conceptually simpler than competing spatially balanced designs, executes faster, and achieves better spatial balance as measured by a number of quantities. The algorithm has been programed in an R package freely available for download.},

The design draws sample locations that are well spread over the study area. Spatially balanced designs are known to be efficient when surveying natural resources because nearby locations tend to be similar. The HIP design uses structural properties of the Halton sequence to partition a resource into nested boxes. Sample locations are then drawn from specific boxes in the partition to ensure spatial diversity. The method is conceptually simple and computationally efficient, draws spatially balanced samples in two or more dimensions and uses standard design-based estimators. Furthermore, HIP samples have an implicit ordering that can be used to define spatially balanced over-samples. This feature is particularly useful when sampling natural resources because we can dynamically add spatially balanced units from the over-sample to the sample as non-target or inaccessible units are discovered. We use several populations to show that HIP sampling draws spatially balanced samples and gives precise estimates of population totals.},

To achieve reliable estimates of population characteristics, the spatial pattern of the sample should be similar to the underlying spatial pattern of the population. A reasonable assumption for natural resources is that nearby locations tend to have more similar response values than distant locations. Hence, sample efficiency can be increased by spreading sample locations evenly over a natural resource. A sample that is well-spread over the resource is called spatially balanced and many spatially balanced sampling designs have been proposed in the statistical literature. Robertson et al. (Environ Ecol Stat 25:305--323, 2018) proposed a sampling design that draws spatially balanced samples using a nested partition. This article modifies their partitioning strategy to spatially order a point resource into a highly structured master frame. Samples of consecutive points from the master frame are spatially balanced and these individual samples can be easily incorporated into a broader spatially balanced design for integrated monitoring. Numerical results show that the master frame's ordering is effective and that a range of samples drawn from it are spatially balanced.},

All we require is a measure of the distance between population units. Numerical results show that the method generates well-spread samples and compares favorably with existing designs. We provide an example application using several auxiliary variables to estimate total aboveground biomass over a large study area in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil. Multipurpose surveys are also considered, where the totals of aboveground biomass, primary production, and clay content (3 responses) are estimated from a single well-spread sample over the auxiliary space.},

Data-driven causal inference in such systems is challenging since datasets are often high dimensional and nonlinear with limited sample sizes. Here, we introduce a novel method that flexibly combines linear or nonlinear conditional independence tests with a causal discovery algorithm to estimate causal networks from large-scale time series datasets. We validate the method on time series of well-understood physical mechanisms in the climate system and the human heart and using large-scale synthetic datasets mimicking the typical properties of real-world data. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detection power, which opens up entirely new possibilities to discover and quantify causal networks from time series across a range of research fields.},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a novel method of assessing biodiversity wherein samples are taken from the environment via water, sediment or air from which DNA is extracted, and then amplified using general or universal primers in polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using next-generation sequencing to generate thousands to millions of reads. From this data, species presence can be determined, and overall biodiversity assessed. It is an interdisciplinary method that brings together traditional field-based ecology with in-depth molecular methods and advanced computational tools. As an emerging monitoring method, there are many pitfalls and roadblocks to be considered and avoided, but the method may still have the ability to revolutionize modern biodiversity surveys for the molecular era. In this paper, we review the basic methodology, benefits, and concerns of eDNA metabarcoding, and systematically cover the applications of the method in global ecology thus far, including biodiversity monitoring across all habitats and taxonomic groups, ancient ecosystem reconstruction, plant-pollinator interactions, diet analysis, invasive species detection, pollution responses, and air quality monitoring. We also discuss the future applications of the method as well as expected technological advances and how they may impact the way that eDNA metabarcoding may used in the future. eDNA metabarcoding is a unique method still in development and will likely remain in flux for some time as technology advances and procedures become standardized. However, as metabarcoding is optimized and its use becomes more widespread, it is likely to become an essential tool for ecological monitoring and global conservation study.},

  abstract = {Automatic classification of animal vocalizations has great potential to enhance the monitoring of species movements and behaviors. This is particularly true for monitoring nocturnal bird migration, where automated classification of migrants' flight calls could yield new biological insights and conservation applications for birds that vocalize during migration. In this paper we investigate the automatic classification of bird species from flight calls, and in particular the relationship between two different problem formulations commonly found in the literature: classifying a short clip containing one of a fixed set of known species (N-class problem) and the continuous monitoring problem, the latter of which is relevant to migration monitoring. We implemented a state-of-the-art audio classification model based on unsupervised feature learning and evaluated it on three novel datasets, one for studying the N-class problem including over 5000 flight calls from 43 different species, and two realistic datasets for studying the monitoring scenario comprising hundreds of thousands of audio clips that were compiled by means of remote acoustic sensors deployed in the field during two migration seasons. We show that the model achieves high accuracy when classifying a clip to one of N known species, even for a large number of species. In contrast, the model does not perform as well in the continuous monitoring case. Through a detailed error analysis (that included full expert review of false positives and negatives) we show the model is confounded by varying background noise conditions and previously unseen vocalizations. We also show that the model needs to be parameterized and benchmarked differently for the continuous monitoring scenario. Finally, we show that despite the reduced performance, given the right conditions the model can still characterize the migration pattern of a specific species. The paper concludes with directions for future research.},

We show that the two models perform comparably on a dataset of 5428 flight calls spanning 43 different species, with both significantly outperforming an MFCC baseline. Finally, we show that by combining the models using a simple late-fusion approach we can further improve the results, obtaining a state-of-the-art c1assification accuracy of 0.96.},

  abstract = {The ability of a researcher to re-identify (re-ID) an individual animal upon re-encounter is fundamental for addressing a broad range of questions in the study of ecosystem function, community and population dynamics and behavioural ecology. Tagging animals during mark and recapture studies is the most common method for reliable animal re-ID; however, camera traps are a desirable alternative, requiring less labour, much less intrusion and prolonged and continuous monitoring into an environment. Despite these advantages, the analyses of camera traps and video for re-ID by humans are criticized for their biases related to human judgement and inconsistencies between analyses. In this review, we describe a brief history of camera traps for re-ID, present a collection of computer vision feature engineering methodologies previously used for animal re-ID, provide an introduction to the underlying mechanisms of deep learning relevant to animal re-ID, highlight the success of deep learning methods for human re-ID, describe the few ecological studies currently utilizing deep learning for camera trap analyses and our predictions for near future methodologies based on the rapid development of deep learning methods. For decades, ecologists with expertise in computer vision have successfully utilized feature engineering to extract meaningful features from camera trap images to improve the statistical rigor of individual comparisons and remove human bias from their camera trap analyses. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of deep learning systems which have demonstrated the accurate re-ID of humans based on image and video data with near perfect accuracy. Despite this success, ecologists have yet to utilize these approaches for animal re-ID. By utilizing novel deep learning methods for object detection and similarity comparisons, ecologists can extract animals from an image/video data and train deep learning classifiers to re-ID animal individuals beyond the capabilities of a human observer. This methodology will allow ecologists with camera/video trap data to reidentify individuals that exit and re-enter the camera frame. Our expectation is that this is just the beginning of a major trend that could stand to revolutionize the analysis of camera trap data and, ultimately, our approach to animal ecology.},

  abstract = {Ecological camera traps are increasingly used by wildlife biologists to unobtrusively monitor an ecosystems animal population. However, manual inspection of the images produced is expensive, laborious, and time-consuming. The success of deep learning systems using camera trap images has been previously explored in preliminary stages. These studies, however, are lacking in their practicality. They are primarily focused on extremely large datasets, often millions of images, and there is little to no focus on performance when tasked with species identification in new locations not seen during training. Our goal was to test the capabilities of deep learning systems trained on camera trap images using modestly sized training data, compare performance when considering unseen background locations, and quantify the gradient of lower bound performance to provide a guideline of data requirements in correspondence to performance expectations. We use a dataset provided by Parks Canada containing 47,279 images collected from 36 unique geographic locations across multiple environments. Images represent 55 animal species and human activity with high-class imbalance. We trained, tested, and compared the capabilities of six deep learning computer vision networks using transfer learning and image augmentation: DenseNet201, Inception-ResNet-V3, InceptionV3, NASNetMobile, MobileNetV2, and Xception. We compare overall performance on ``trained'' locations where DenseNet201 performed best with 95.6\% top-1 accuracy showing promise for deep learning methods for smaller scale research efforts. Using trained locations, classifications with {$<$}500 images had low and highly variable recall of 0.750 {\textpm} 0.329, while classifications with over 1,000 images had a high and stable recall of 0.971 {\textpm} 0.0137. Models tasked with classifying species from untrained locations were less accurate, with DenseNet201 performing best with 68.7\% top-1 accuracy. Finally, we provide an open repository where ecologists can insert their image data to train and test custom species detection models for their desired ecological domain.},

Changes in phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity across environments provide insight into these processes, however, it is challenging to assess the effect of spatial scale on these metrics. Here, we outline a nested sampling design that fractally spaces sampling locations to concentrate statistical power across spatial scales in a study area. We test this design in northeast Utah, at a study site with distinct vegetation types (including sagebrush steppe and mixed conifer forest), that vary across environmental gradients. We demonstrate the power of this design to detect changes in community phylogenetic diversity across environmental gradients and assess the spatial scale at which the sampling design captures the most variation in empirical data. We find clear evidence of broad-scale changes in multiple features of phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity across aspect. At finer scales, we find additional variation in phylodiversity, highlighting the power of our fractal sampling design to efficiently detect patterns across multiple spatial scales. Thus, our fractal sampling design and analysis effectively identify important environmental gradients and spatial scales that drive community phylogenetic structure. We discuss the insights this gives us into the ecological assembly processes that differentiate plant communities found in northeast Utah.},

  abstract = {Monitoring global biodiversity from space through remotely sensing geospatial patterns has high potential to add to our knowledge acquired by field observation. Although a framework of essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) is emerging for monitoring biodiversity, its poor alignment with remote sensing products hinders interpolation between field observations. This study compiles a comprehensive, prioritized list of remote sensing biodiversity products that can further improve the monitoring of geospatial biodiversity patterns, enhancing the EBV framework and its applicability. The ecosystem structure and ecosystem function EBV classes, which capture the biological effects of disturbance as well as habitat structure, are shown by an expert review process to be the most relevant, feasible, accurate and mature for direct monitoring of biodiversity from satellites. Biodiversity products that require satellite remote sensing of a finer resolution that is still under development are given lower priority (for example, for the EBV class species traits). Some EBVs are not directly measurable by remote sensing from space, specifically the EBV class genetic composition. Linking remote sensing products to EBVs will accelerate product generation, improving reporting on the state of biodiversity from local to global scales.},

  abstract = {Effective conservation of ecological communities requires accurate and up-to-date information about whether species are persisting or declining to extinction. The persistence of ecological communities is largely supported by its structured architecture of species interactions, known as an ecological network. While the persistence of the network supporting the whole community is the most relevant scale for conservation, in practice, we can only monitor small subsets of these networks due to logistical sampling constraints. There is therefore an urgent need to establish links between the small snapshots of data conservationists are able to collect, and the `big picture' conclusions about ecosystem health demanded by policy makers, scientists and societies. Here we show that the persistence of small subnetworks in isolation --- that is, their persistence when considered separately from the larger network of which they are a part --- is a reliable probabilistic indicator of the persistence of the network as a whole. Our results are general across both antagonistic and mutualistic interaction networks. Empirically, we show that our theoretical predictions are supported by data on invaded networks in restored and unrestored areas, even in the presence of environmental variability. Our work suggests that coordinated action to aggregate information from incomplete sampling can provide a means to rapidly assess the persistence of entire ecological networks and the expected success of restoration strategies. This could significantly improve our ability to monitor progress towards achieving policy targets, such as those enshrined in the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.},

  abstract = {Geographic profiling, a mathematical model originally developed in criminology, is increasingly being used in ecology and epidemiology. Geographic profiling boasts a wide range of applications, such as finding source populations of invasive species or breeding sites of vectors of infectious disease. The model provides a cost-effective approach for prioritizing search strategies for source locations and does so via simple data in the form of the positions of each observation, such as individual sightings of invasive species or cases of a disease. In doing so, however, classic geographic profiling approaches fail to make the distinction between those areas containing observed absences and those areas where no data were recorded. Absence data are generated via spatial sampling protocols but are often discarded during the inference process. Here we construct a geographic profiling model that resolves these issues by making inferences via count data, analyzing a set of discrete sentinel locations at which the number of encounters has been recorded. Crucially, in our model this number can be zero. We verify the ability of this new model to estimate source locations and other parameters of practical interest via a Bayesian power analysis. We also measure model performance via real-world data in which the model infers breeding locations of mosquitoes in bromeliads in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. In both cases, our novel model produces more efficient search strategies by shifting focus from those areas containing observed absences to those with no data, an improvement over existing models that treat these areas equally. Our model makes important improvements upon classic geographic profiling methods, which will significantly enhance real-world efforts to develop conservation management plans and targeted interventions.},

However, its unbounded and uninterpretable scale of measurement does not allow to assess the level of spatial spreading in absolute terms and confines its use to only raw comparisons.

  abstract = {Although species are being lost at alarming rates, previous research has provided conflicting results on the extent and even direction of global biodiversity change at the local scale. Here, we assessed the ability to detect global biodiversity trends using local species richness and how it is affected by the number of monitoring sites, sampling interval (i.e. time between original survey and re-survey of the site), measurement error (error of the measurement of the local species richness), spatial grain of monitoring (a proxy for the taxa mobility) and spatial sampling biases (i.e. site-selection biases). We use PREDICTS model-based estimates as a proxy for the real-world distribution of biodiversity and randomly selected monitoring sites to calculate local species richness trends. We found that while a monitoring network with hundreds of sites could detect global change in species richness within a 30-year period, the number of sites for detecting trends doubled for a decade, increased 10-fold within three years and yearly trends were undetectable. Measurement errors had a non-linear effect on statistical power, with a 1\% error reducing statistical power by a slight margin and a 5\% error drastically reducing the power to reliably detect any trend. The ability to detect global change in local species richness was also related to spatial grain, making it harder to detect trends for sites sampled at smaller plot sizes. Spatial sampling biases not only reduced the ability to detect negative global biodiversity trends but sometimes yielded positive trends. We conclude that detecting accurate global biodiversity trends using local richness may simply be unfeasible with current approaches. We suggest that monitoring a representative network of sites implemented at the national level, combined with models accounting for errors and biases, can help improve our understanding of global biodiversity change.},

  abstract = {Well-designed environmental monitoring programmes for management organisations are important for evidence-based decision making. However, many environmental problems are not single agency issues that require intervention or monitoring at one spatial scale. A master sample can be used to coordinate and scale monitoring designs to ensure consistency in information gathered and robustness of estimators at the different spatial scales. We propose using balanced acceptance sampling (BAS) to generate a master sample. In this context, practical applications and justification of BAS as a master sample are addressed. These include sample generation, stratification, unequal probability sampling, rotating panel designs, and regional intensification. A method for incorporating legacy sites is also provided. Using BAS as a master sample is conceptually simple, gives good spatial balance over different spatial scales, and is computationally efficient to generate. An example for terrestrial biodiversity monitoring in New Zealand is provided. Environmental monitoring can benefit from increased coordination between agencies. A master sample is an excellent way to incorporate coordination directly into the sample design. BAS improves on methods previously described and provides an effective method to monitor populations at multiple spatial scales.},

Avian migratory movements across the United States likely exceed 500 million individuals per night during peak passage.

  abstract = {Animal migration is one of nature's most spectacular phenomena, but migratory animals and their journeys are imperilled across the globe. Migratory birds are among the most well-studied animals on Earth, yet relatively little is known about in-flight behaviour during nocturnal migration. Because many migrating bird species vocalize during flight, passive acoustic monitoring shows great promise for facilitating widespread monitoring of bird migration. Here, we present Nighthawk, a deep learning model designed to detect and identify the vocalizations of nocturnally migrating birds. We trained Nighthawk on the in-flight vocalizations of migratory birds using a diverse dataset of recordings from across the Americas. Our results demonstrate that Nighthawk performs well as a nocturnal flight call detector and classifier for dozens of avian taxa, both at the species level and for broader taxonomic groups (e.g. orders and families). It achieves an average precision score above 0.80 for 50 species and a mean average precision of 0.96 across 4 orders. The model accurately quantified nightly nocturnal migration intensity (80\% variation explained) and species phenology (78\% variation explained) and performed well on data from across North America. Incorporating modest amounts of additional annotated audio (50--120 h) into model training yielded high performance on target datasets from both North and South America (average precision on order Passeriformes {$>$}0.99). By monitoring the vocalizations of actively migrating birds, Nighthawk provides a detailed window onto nocturnal bird migration that is not presently attainable by other means (e.g. radar or citizen science). Scientists, managers and practitioners could use acoustic monitoring with Nighthawk for a number of applications, including: monitoring migration passage at wind farms; studying airspace usage during migratory flights; monitoring the changing migrations of species susceptible to climate change; and revealing previously unknown migration routes and behaviours. Overall, this work will empower diverse stakeholders to efficiently monitor migrating birds across the Western Hemisphere and collect data in aid of science and conservation.},

  abstract = {Spatial sampling is an important issue in environmental studies because the sample configuration influences both costs and effectiveness of a survey. Practical sampling constraints and available preinformation can help to optimize the sampling scheme. In this paper, spatial simulated annealing (SSA) is presented as a method to optimize spatial environmental sampling schemes. Sampling schemes are optimized at the point-level, taking into account sampling constraints and preliminary observations. Two optimization criteria have been used. The first optimizes even spreading of the points over a region, whereas the second optimizes variogram estimation using a proposed criterion from the literature. For several examples it is shown that SSA is superior to conventional methods of designing sampling schemes. Improvements up to 30\% occur for the first criterion, and an almost complete solution is found for the second criterion. Spatial simulated annealing is especially useful in studies with many sampling constraints. It is flexible in implementing additional, quantitative criteria.},

Experimental approaches to develop these estimates are often cost-prohibitive or are logistically impractical. As a result, a large and active literature has arisen that attempts to model the suitability of habitat for species and communities based on statistical analysis of current patterns of their occurrence and co-occurrence at large geographic scales. Despite being instrumental to many real-world decisions, these models are accompanied by many sources of uncertainty that are often ignored or poorly communicated. In this chapter, we focus on a subset of these methods, called ``species distribution models,'' to highlight some of the key uncertainties that arise when modeling ecological processes from occurrence data.},

Obtaining those sample sizes can be more feasible when volunteers contribute to the dataset, but volunteer-selected sites are not always representative of a population. Previous work to account for biased site selection has relied on knowledge of covariates to explain differences between site types, but such knowledge is often unavailable. For cases where relevant covariates have not been defined, we used a simulation study to identify the consequences of including non-probabilistically selected sites (NP sites) in addition to sites selected from a probability-based design (P sites), test modeling frameworks that might correct for biases, and evaluate whether those frameworks could allow NP sites to reduce the sampling requirement for P sites and potentially reduce costs of monitoring. We informed the simulation with pilot data from surveys of monarch butterflies and their obligate larval host plant, milkweed. We found strong biases in NP sites versus P sites in density and trends of monarchs and milkweed. Modeling frameworks that accounted for site type with a group effect or that strongly downweighted NP sites successfully produced unbiased estimates. However, sampling more NP sites typically did not improve accuracy or precision, and adding NP sites sometimes required also adding P sites to prevent biases. Further work on novel modeling frameworks would be useful to allow citizen-science data to contribute useful information to conservation.},

I first present an overview of the theory and past work that has tried to address this question. As a test of these approaches, I then examine 822 populations of vertebrate species. I show that 72\% of time series required at least 10 years of continuous monitoring in order to achieve a high level of statistical power. However, the large variability between populations casts doubt on commonly used simple rules of thumb, such as those employed by the IUCN Red List. I argue that statistical power needs to be considered more often in monitoring programs. Short time series are likely underpowered and potentially misleading.},

Efficiently identifying the species captured by each image is a critical challenge for the advancement of this field. Here, we present an automated species identification method for wildlife pictures captured by remote camera traps. Our process starts with images that are cropped out of the background. We then use improved sparse coding spatial pyramid matching (ScSPM), which extracts dense SIFT descriptor and cell-structured LBP (cLBP) as the local features, that generates global feature via weighted sparse coding and max pooling using multi-scale pyramid kernel, and classifies the images by a linear support vector machine algorithm. Weighted sparse coding is used to enforce both sparsity and locality of encoding in feature space. We tested the method on a dataset with over 7,000 camera trap images of 18 species from two different field cites, and achieved an average classification accuracy of 82\%. Our analysis demonstrates that the combination of SIFT and cLBP can serve as a useful technique for animal species recognition in real, complex scenarios.},

Here, based on analysis of standardized routes from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (3,014 routes sampled over 18 years),3 we demonstrate that major local habitat change is associated with an increase in the rate of survey cessations. We further show that routes that were continued despite major habitat changes show reduced diversity. By simulating potential rates of loss, we show that the underlying real trends in taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity can even reverse in sign if more than a quarter of diversity is lost from routes that ceased and are thus no longer included in surveys. Our analyses imply that biodiversity loss can be underestimated by biases introduced if continued sampling in longitudinal studies is influenced by local change. We argue that researchers and conservation practitioners should be aware of the potential for bias in such data and seek to use more robust methods to evaluate biodiversity trends and make conservation decisions.},
